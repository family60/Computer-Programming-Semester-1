			This movie is about a park out in the distant seas. The goal of the people running the park is to revive
			the jurassic experience after the outbreak in the previous jurassic park movies. They want to show the
			public that these dinosaurs can be tamed and provide a fun family experience for all. However, they think
			they can breed hybrid dinosaurs with no concequences - they were wrong to thing suck. The I-rex breaks out
			of its cage and causes trouble for the entire park, forcing everyone to evacuate the new park. The main
			characters - with the help of some dino friends - manage to take down the I-rex and save the park from
			total anhiliation.
