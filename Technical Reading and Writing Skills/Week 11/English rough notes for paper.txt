Philosophy and morals is best taught in a learning envirnment through a curriculum, however, one can still get
a good understanding of those topics without having to commit to a learning envirnment. This strategy can be
explored through many different media such as websites, movies, tc shows, books etc. I'm going to be looking at 
what exactly morality is and which medias in particular can provide a satisfactory understanding on this topic.
