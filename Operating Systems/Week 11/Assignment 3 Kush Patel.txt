1. The sed command is mainly used for text substitution. For example, you can sed <file name> and then
perform tasks like find and replace, insertion, deletion, search and much more.

2. The tr command is used to translate or tranliterate text. For example, you can choose to translate
lower case to upper case by doing tr [:lower:] [:upper:]

3. the tee command is used to read input and write it to both output and one or more files.
for eg: tee -a file1.txt file2.txt

due to password issues I am having with my humber account. Therefor, I am using the method I know off the top
of my head and do not need a terminal to verify. ( Sorry :( )
