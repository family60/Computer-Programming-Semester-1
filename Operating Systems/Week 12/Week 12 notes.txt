Hard Link
-------------------
creation: ln name-of-file  name-of-link
	- points to the inode of the file
        - if the file is deleted the hard link would still be active
        - if the file is changed the hard link would be UPDATED 
	  (b/c pointing to to the inode)
        - Applicable to files only
        - Valid within the same file system

Soft(Sym) Link
-------------------
creation: ln -s name-of-file  name-of-link 
	 - is linking to the file name
         - if the file is deleted/renamed the symbolic link would not be valid
         - if the is changed the symbolic link will reflect the new content. 
         - Applicable to files and directories
         - valid across different file systems

inode : a data structure representing a file on the disk 
	   name, size, ...

a hidden file is a file that is not visible to the user

to create a hidden file, you will start it with a "."
eg: touch .<file name>
therefor : [ls -l] will not show hidden files, you must do [ls -l -a] to see all files

Why make hidden files?:
	1. security
	2. cleanup the directory
	3. backup
